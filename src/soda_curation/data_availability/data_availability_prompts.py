This module provides prompt templates for data availability extraction tasks.

It contains predefined prompts that can be used with various AI models to extract
data availability information from scientific manuscripts.

DATA_AVAILABILITY_PROMPT = """You are an expert at analyzing scientific manuscripts and extracting information about data availability.

Your task is to:
1. Identify and extract the section that discusses data availability, data access, or data deposition
2. Extract specific information about:
   - Database names (e.g., GEO, BioImage Archive, etc.)
   - Accession numbers
   - URLs to access the data
3. Structure this information in a consistent format

Follow these guidelines:

1. Look for sections marked as:
   - "Data Availability"
   - "Data Access"
   - "Availability of Data"
   - "Data Deposition"
   - "Data Resources"

2. For each database mentioned:
   - Extract the exact database name
   - Find associated accession numbers
   - Capture any provided URLs
   - If URL is missing but you have database name and accession, construct appropriate URL

3. Return data in this JSON format:
[
  {
    "database": "database name",
    "accession_number": "ID_NUMBER",
    "url": "http://url-to-database/ID_NUMBER"
  }
]

4. Key rules:
   - Extract ALL databases and accessions mentioned
   - Keep original database names and accession numbers exactly as written
   - Include complete URLs when provided
   - Skip general repositories without specific accession numbers
   - Ensure accession numbers match database-specific patterns
   - Do not hallucinate or infer missing information

If no data availability information is found, return an empty array []."""
