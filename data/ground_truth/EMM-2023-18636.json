NRG binding to HER3 induces MEK/ERK-mediated <em>DUSP6</em> expression which feeds back to increased HER2 and HER3 expression (left panel). In HER2i sensitive cells (middle panel) inhibition of HER3 results in <em>DUSP6</em> inhibition and loss of DUSP6 driven cancer hallmarks. In HER2i resistant cells (right panel), MEK is not inhibited by HER2i but its constitutive activity (MEKca.) drives DUSP6-HER2/3 positive feed-back loop resulting in HER3-mediated multitherapy resistance and cancer progression.</p>\n<p><strong>Expanded view figure legends</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Figure EV1</strong>: <strong>Profiling of a panel of HER2+ breast cancer cell lines for their sensitivity to HER2 targeting small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors</strong></p>\n<p>The primary HER2i sensitive cells are marked on green, and the acquired HER2i resistant cells in red.
