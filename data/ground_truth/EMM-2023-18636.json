      "figure_caption": "(A) Development of lapatinib resistance in HER2+ breast cancer cells. BT474 and BT474Br cells were treated with 1 M of lapatinib for 9 days (d), 6 months (mos) and 9 mos to yield Drug-tolerant persister (DTP), Drug-tolerant expanding perister (DTEP) and Long term resistant (LR) clones, respectively. The cells were stained with crystal violet (0.5% w/v) and the images were acquired with an inverted microscope. The transcriptional profiles from each functional state of lapatinib drug tolerance and resistance development from three parallel BT474 cell plates were surveyed by RNA-sequencing. (B) The number of the genes with a significant change in their expression during the resistance acquisition (see Dataset EV1 for individual gene names). Transcription factor (TF) binding motifs significantly enriched in significantly regulated genes in each transition are indicated. Bolding indicates shared TF binding sites between DTP downregulated and DTEP upregulated genes. (C) Differentially expressed pathways were identified using the R package limma and hallmark gene sets were used for GSVA analysis to reveal hallmarks and signal transduction pathways involved in each step of the resistance acquisition. Red indicates those hallmarks and pathways that are overlapping with processes regulated by DUSP6 depletion in figure 3F.\n\nFigure 2: Clinical association of DUSP6 overexpression with poor prognosis HER2+ breast cancers. (A, B) Volcano plots visualizing differentially expressed genes in (A) Control-DTP and (B) DTP-DTEP transitions. The volcano blots indicate \n\n\n\nall genes that were significantly regulated during these transitions (|logFC |<2 and FDR <0.05), whereas only the phosphatase genes among these are indicated by names. The four phosphatase genes significantly regulated in both transitions (DUSP6, CDC25A, CDC25C, and SYNJ1) are indicated in bold. Differentially expressed genes were identified using the R package limma (n=3). (C) Changes in the DUSP6, CDC25A, CDC25C, and SYNJ1 mRNA levels during the acquisition of lapatinib resistance in BT474 cells. Data is based on RNA sequencing analysis (Dataset EV1) and was analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test. Statistically significant values of *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ***p < 0.001 were determined (n=3). (D) Differential expression of DUSP6, CDC25A, CDC25C, and SYNJ1 in different breast cancer subtypes. Data were extracted from the METABRIC dataset and categorized into five molecular subtypes according to the PAM50 gene expression subtype classification (basal, claudin-low, HER2+, Luminal A, and Luminal B). Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test and shown as mean  standard deviation (SD). Statistically significant values of *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 and ****p < 0.0001 were determined (basal=209, claudin-low=218, HER2+=224, LumA=700 and LumB=475). (E) Breast cancer patients from the TCGA-BRCA dataset were divided into DUSP6 high (LogFC>1, FDR<0.05) and low expression (LogFC<-1, FDR<0.05) groups and the clinical breast cancer subtypes were compared between the two groups. NA; not available. (F,G) Subgroup of 113 patient cases with high tumor ERBB2 mRNA expression (LogFC>1, FDR<0.05) were divided into DUSP6high and DUSP6low groups and their overall survival (OS) (G) (Log-rank Test p value=0.0220) and disease-specific progression free survival (PFS)(H)(Log-rank Test p value=0.0259) was tested according to DUSP6 status. \n\n\n\nFigure 3: Functional involvement of DUSP6 in HER2i tolerance development. \n\n(A) Expression of DUSP6 protein in different stages of lapatinib resistance development by Western blot analysis. (B) Relative expression of DUSP6 mRNA in indicated cell lines either at the untreated control situation, or in the DTP state after following treatments: BT474Br, Lapatinib 1M for 9 days; EFM192A and HCC1419, Lapatinib 2.5 M for 14 days; HCC827(EGFRmut NSCLC), 1 µM Osimertinib for 10 days; A375(BRAFV600E mutant malignant melanoma (MM)), 1 µM dabrafenib+100 nM trametinib for 10 days; and HT-29(BRAFV600E mutant colorectal cancer (CRC)), 1 µM dabrafenib+10 µg/ml cetuximab for 10 days. Data for EFM192 and HCC1419 cells was obtained from (DataRef: (Chang et al., 2022)(GSE155342), and for other cells by qRT-PCR analysis of the de novo treated samples.

(D) A 2D synergy map of neratinib-BCI combination in MDA-MB-453 cells calculated by Bliss SynergyFinder (Ianevski et al., 2017). Higher score (in red) indicates for higher degree of drug synergy. The cultures were treated with increasing concentrations of the compounds for 48 h and cell viability was measured by WST-1 assay. (E) DUSP6 siRNA knockdown increases sensitivity of HER2i resistant MDA-MB-453 cells to combination with capecitabine and neratinib. Cell viability was measured by WST-1 assay after 48 h of drug treatment. Data were collected from three independent experiments each performed in triplicate and \n\n\n\nanalyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons test.

(F) The effect of NRG on DUSP6 protein expression BT474 cells via MEK activation. The cells were serum-starved for 24 h, followed by treatment with NRG (10 ng/mL), MK2206 (2.5 µM) and trametinib (100 nM) for 48 h. (G) Inhibition of DUSP6 expression in HER2i resistant MDA-MB-453 cells by MEKi Trametinib. The cells were treated with MK2206 (2.5 µM) or trametinib (100 nM) for \n\n\n\n48 h. (H) A schematic illustration of the discovered HER3/DUSP6 feed forward loop in HER2+ breast cancer cells. NRG binding to HER3 induces MEK/ERK-mediated DUSP6 expression which feeds back to increased HER2 and HER3 expression (left panel). In HER2i sensitive cells (middle panel) inhibition of HER3 results in DUSP6 inhibition and loss of DUSP6 driven cancer hallmarks. In HER2i resistant cells (right panel), MEK is not inhibited by HER2i but its constitutive activity (MEKca.) drives DUSP6-HER2/3 positive feed-back loop resulting in HER3-mediated multitherapy resistance and cancer progression.",

BT474 and BT474Br cells were treated with 1 M of lapatinib for 9 days (d), 6 months (mos) and 9 mos to yield Drug-tolerant persister (DTP), Drug-tolerant expanding perister (DTEP) and Long term resistant (LR) clones, respectively. The cells were stained with crystal violet (0.5% w/v) and the images were acquired with an inverted microscope. The transcriptional profiles from each functional state of lapatinib drug tolerance and resistance development from three parallel BT474 cell plates were surveyed by RNA-sequencing.
