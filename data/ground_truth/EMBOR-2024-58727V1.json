The data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments after analysis by two tailed Student\u2019s T-test. P=2.86E-05 (JAM3), P=4.06E-06 (KNTC1), P=1.31E-04(SMC2), P=9.18E-06(SMC4), P=1.91E-05(LMNB1) and P=1.47E-04 (FOXM1). Figure 6 Simultaneous targeting of KDM5C and YY1 effectively induces cell cycle arrest in the G2\/M phase and apoptosis. A. Cell cycle analysis with the indicated cell lines via flow cytometry. The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle is shown on the Y-axis. Each experiment was repeated three times with similar results. \u201cDouble sh\u201d indicates cells with simultaneous knockdown of KDM5C and YY1. B. Flow cytometry\u2013based Annexin-V\/PI staining showing cells in the indicated lineages undergoing apoptosis. The quantitative results indicate the ratio of apoptotic cells. Each experiment was repeated three times with similar results. \u201cDouble sh\u201d indicates cells with simultaneous knockdown of KDM5C and YY1. The data are shown as the mean \u00b1 SD of three independent experiments after analysis by two tailed Student\u2019s T-test. P=5.3E-05 (RCC4) and P=1.1E-06 (769-P). Figure 7 A mechanistic hypothesis model for KDM5C-mediated YY1 recruitment.  YY1 and KDM5C constitute a pair of synthetic lethal genes. KDM5C recruits YY1 to the promoter regions of cell cycle- or apoptosis-related genes. Targeting YY1 increases the vulnerability of KDM5C-deficient cancer cells."
