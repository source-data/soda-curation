  "all_captions": "Figure 1-Proteasomal and lysosomal pathways for clearance of misfolded proteins from the ER. A ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways rely on mannose processing by EDEM proteins that interrupts futile folding cycles in the CNX chaperone system and engages mannose-binding lectins (OS9). Retro-translocation machineries (Dislocons) built around membrane-embedded E3 ubiquitin ligases ensure client-specific dislocation across the ER membrane and poly-ubiquitylation that precedes proteasomal degradation. B ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation (ERLAD) pathways. For ATZ and pro-collagen, selection for ERLAD relies on cycles of de-/re-glucosylation that prolong CNX binding and lead to association with the FAM134B (Forrester et al., 2019; Fregno et al., 2018; Fregno et al., 2021). ERLAD clients are eventually cleared in endolysosomes or in autolysosomes, where they are delivered via mechanistically distinct pathways shown with arrows 1-3. \nFigure 2-The ERAD client NHK is re-directed to LAMP1-positive endolysosomes for degradation upon pharmacologic inactivation of ERAD. (A) HEK239 cells transiently expressing the 35S-NHK are chased for the indicated time without (lanes 1-3) or with PS341 (lanes 4, 5), PS341/BafA1 (lanes 6, 7), KIF (lanes 8, 9), or KIF/BafA1 (10-11). Radiolabeled NHK is immunoisolated at the end of the indicated chase time and separated in SDS-PAGE. Densitometric quantification of the 35S-NHK band in this representative experiment is shown. (B) Quantification of 35S-NHK after a 10- or 120-min chase in cells mock treated or exposed to PS341 or PS341/BafA1. Individual data points at 120-min (%, normalized to 10’ mock): mock= 49, 37 and 49%; PS341= 73, 55 and 52%; PS341/BafA1= 91, 63 and 68%. (C) Same as (B) for Kif, KIF/BafA1. Individual data points at 120-min (%, normalized to 10-min mock): mock= 49, 37 and 49%; KIF= 80, 53 and 54%; KIF/BafA1= 99, 64 and 83%. (D) BafA1 does not inhibit clearance of the ERAD client NHK. n=3 for 10- and 120-min; n=2 for 120-min BafA1. (E) ATZ, a canonical ERLAD client accumulates within LAMP1-positive endolysosomes in 3T3 cells exposed to BafA1. (F) The ERAD client NHK is not delivered within LAMP1-positive endolysosomes. (G-H) NHK is delivered and accumulates within endolysosomes inactivated with BafA1 upon ERAD inhibition with KIF (G) or with PS341 (H).

(A-C) Same as Figs. 2A-2C for BACE457D. (A) HEK239 cells transiently expressing the 35S- BACE457D are chased for the indicated time without (lanes 1-3) or with PS341 (lanes 4, 5), PS341/BafA1 (lanes 6, 7), KIF (lanes 8, 9), or KIF/BafA1 (10-11).

Insets are shown with white squares.\nFigure 7-Schematic representation of how pharmacologic (blue) and genetic (red) ERAD perturbation triggers compensatory ERLAD programs. Defective proteasomal clearance of NHK and BACE457D activates FAM134B-driven ERLAD. Other clients or maintenance of ER homeostasis in specific tissues may activate other ER-phagy receptors (e.g., CCPG1 in the pancreas and FAM134B-2 in the liver)."
