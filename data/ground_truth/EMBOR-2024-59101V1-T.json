Retro-translocation\nmachineries (Dislocons) built around membrane-embedded E3 ubiquitin\nligases ensure client-specific dislocation across the ER membrane and\npoly-ubiquitylation that precedes proteasomal degradation.\n<strong>B</strong> ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation (ERLAD)\npathways. For ATZ and pro-collagen, selection for ERLAD relies on cycles\nof de-/re-glucosylation that prolong CNX binding and lead to association\nwith the FAM134B (Forrester <em>et al.</em>, 2019; Fregno <em>et\nal.</em>, 2018; Fregno <em>et al.</em>, 2021). ERLAD clients are\neventually cleared in endolysosomes or in autolysosomes, where they are\ndelivered via mechanistically distinct pathways shown with arrows\n1-3.</p>\n<p><strong><br />\n</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 2</strong>-The ERAD client NHK is re-directed to\nLAMP1-positive endolysosomes for degradation upon pharmacologic\ninactivation of ERAD.
