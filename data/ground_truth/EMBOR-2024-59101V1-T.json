      "figure_caption": "A ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways rely on mannose processing by EDEM proteins that interrupts futile folding cycles in the CNX chaperone system and engages mannose-binding lectins (OS9). Retro-translocation machineries (Dislocons) built around membrane-embedded E3 ubiquitin ligases ensure client-specific dislocation across the ER membrane and poly-ubiquitylation that precedes proteasomal degradation. B ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation (ERLAD) pathways. For ATZ and pro-collagen, selection for ERLAD relies on cycles of de-/re-glucosylation that prolong CNX binding and lead to association with the FAM134B (Forrester et al., 2019; Fregno et al., 2018; Fregno et al., 2021). ERLAD clients are eventually cleared in endolysosomes or in autolysosomes, where they are delivered via mechanistically distinct pathways shown with arrows 1-3. ",

A ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways rely on mannose processing by EDEM proteins that interrupts futile folding cycles in the CNX chaperone system and engages mannose-binding lectins (OS9). Retro-translocation machineries (Dislocons) built around membrane-embedded E3 ubiquitin ligases ensure client-specific dislocation across the ER membrane and poly-ubiquitylation that precedes proteasomal degradation. B ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation (ERLAD) pathways. For ATZ and pro-collagen, selection for ERLAD relies on cycles of de-/re-glucosylation that prolong CNX binding and lead to association with the FAM134B (Forrester et al., 2019; Fregno et al., 2018; Fregno et al., 2021). ERLAD clients are eventually cleared in endolysosomes or in autolysosomes, where they are delivered via mechanistically distinct pathways shown with arrows 1-3. \n\n\n\nFigure 2-The ERAD client NHK is re-directed to LAMP1-positive endolysosomes for degradation upon pharmacologic inactivation of ERAD.

(H-J) Analysis of NHK delivery to LAMP1-positive lysosomes in FAM134B-KO cells as in (E-G), when ERAD is inhibited with PS341. K LysoQuant quantification of D-J (n=39, 35, 37, 39, 31, 30 and 35 cells, respectively). \n\nData Information (C) Mean is shown. N=3 independent experiments, Unpaired t-test, nsP> 0.05. (K) Mean is shown. N=2 independent experiments. (B, D-J) Scale bars: 10M. Insets are shown with white squares.\n\n\n\nFigure 5-The LC3 lipidation machinery is involved, autophagosome biogenesis is dispensable, for delivery of NHK to LAMP1-positive endolysosomes upon ERAD inactivation. (A-C) Same as Figs. 2F-2H, in MEF. (A) The ERAD client NHK is not delivered to LAMP1-positive endolysosomes. NHK is delivered and accumulates within endolysosomes inactivated with BafA1 upon ERAD inhibition with KIF (B) or with PS341 (C).\n\nD Western blots showing deletion of ATG7 (left panels) and defective LC3 lipidation in ATG7-KO upon starvation (right panels). (E) NHK does not accumulate in LAMP1-positive endolysosomes in ATG7-KO cells. (F) Western blot showing deletion of ATG13 in MEF. (G) NHK delivery within LAMP1-positive endolysosomes is not perturbed in ATG13-KO MEF. (H ) LysoQuant quantification of A-C, E, G (n=17, 57, 29, 46 and 50 cells, respectively). \n\nData Information: (H) Mean is shown. N=3 independent experiments. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett’s multiple comparison test, nsP> 0.05, ****P<0.0001. (A-C, E, G) Scale bars: 10M. Insets are shown with white squares.\n\n\n\nFigure 6-The ERAD client BACE457D is re-directed to endolysosomes for degradation upon pharmacologic inactivation of ERAD. (A-C) Same as Figs. 2A-2C for BACE457D. (A) HEK239 cells transiently expressing the 35S- BACE457D are chased for the indicated time without (lanes 1-3) or with PS341 (lanes 4, 5), PS341/BafA1 (lanes 6, 7), KIF (lanes 8, 9), or KIF/BafA1 (10-11). Radiolabelled BACE457D is immunoisolated at the end of the indicated chase time and separated in SDS-PAGE. Densitometric quantification of the 35S-BACE457D band in the representative experiment is shown. (B-C) Quantification of 35S- BACE457D after a 10- or 120-min chase in cells mock treated, exposed to PS341 or PS341/BafA1 (B) or to KIF, KIF/BafA1 (C). Individual data points at 120-min (%, normalized to 10-min mock): for (B) mock= 36 and 54%; PS341= 70 and 84%; PS341/BafA1= 97 and 99%. For (C): mock= 36 and 54%; KIF= 72 and 75%; KIF/BafA1= 91 and 85%. (D) The ERAD client BACE457D does not accumulate within LAMP1-positive endolysosomes upon BafA1 exposure in MEF cells. (E) BACE457D is delivered and accumulates within endolysosomes upon ERAD inhibition with KIF. (F) Same as E, when ERAD is inhibited with PS341. (G) LysoQuant quantification of D-F (n=33, 37 and 17 cells, respectively). (H) BACE457D is not delivered in LAMP1-positive endolysosomes in MEF lacking FAM134B. \n\n(I-N) Same as Fig. 4E-J for BACE457D. Analysis of BACE457D delivery to LAMP1-positive endolysosomes in FAM134B KO cells treated with BafA1 and KIF (I-K) or BafA1 and PS341 (L-N). BACE457D is not delivered to endolysosomes in cells with deficient ERAD. Back-transfection of FAM134B (J, M) but not FAM134BLIR (K, N) restores delivery. (O) LysoQuant quantification of H-N (n=24, 40, 36, 47, 14, 20 and 16 cells, respectively). \n\nData Information: (B, C) N=2 independent experiments, mean +/- SEM is shown. (G, O) Mean is shown. N=2 independent experiments. (D-F, H-N) Scale bars: 10M. Insets are shown with white squares. \n\nFigure 7-Schematic representation of how pharmacologic (blue) and genetic (red) ERAD perturbation triggers compensatory ERLAD programs. Defective proteasomal clearance of NHK and BACE457D activates FAM134B-driven ERLAD. Other clients or maintenance of ER homeostasis in specific tissues may activate other ER-phagy receptors (e.g., CCPG1 in the pancreas and FAM134B-2 in the liver)."
