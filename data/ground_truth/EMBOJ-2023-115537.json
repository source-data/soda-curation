Autophagy adaptors show distinct distributions during Parkin-mediated mitophagy.\n(A and B) Representative images (left) and spline graphs of the intensity profiles along the indicated arrows (from position 0) in the respective images (right) of wild-type HeLa cells expressing one of the GFP-tagged autophagy adaptors or ubiquitin, mRuby–Omp25, and HaloTag7–LC3B at 45 min after CCCP treatment. Separate mitochondria without contacting other mitochondria or isolation membranes (A; Mt) or mitochondria with an isolation membrane (B; Mt–IM) are shown. The y-axis in each of the graphs indicates the fluorescence intensity. Scale bars indicate 1 μm.\n(C) The relative intensity of GFP-tagged adaptors or ubiquitin (a and b) in LC3B-positive areas compared with LC3B-negative areas in panel B. GFP signals were normalized to the mRuby–Omp25 signals (a′ and b′) using the formula Relative Intensity = (a/b)/(a′/b′), where a and a′ represent the intensities in the LC3B-positive area, and b and b′ represent the intensities in the LC3B-negative area. Solid horizontal bars indicate the means, and dots indicate the data from five structures. Differences were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance with Dunnett’s post-hoc test.\n(D) Immunostaining of endogenous OPTN or NDP52 in wild-type HeLa cells expressing mRuby–Omp25 and HaloTag7–LC3B at 45 min after CCCP treatment.

OPTN and NDP52 show a dynamic exchange between the mitochondrial surface and cytosol.\n(A–D) Representative images (A and C) and quantification (B and D) of GFP fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) on separate mitochondria (Mt) (A and B) or on mitochondria with an isolation membrane (Mt–IM) (C and D) in HeLa cells lacking all five autophagy adaptors (penta KO cells) expressing GFP-tagged adaptors or ubiquitin at 45 min after CCCP treatment. The photobleached areas are indicated by dotted lines. The magnified panels display time-lapse images of the photobleached areas. Scale bars indicate 2 μm and 1 μm (magnified images). Data were collected from four structures and were fitted to the equation y = a*(1 − exp(−b*x)). The dark shaded areas represent the 95% confidence intervals, and the light shaded areas represent the 95% prediction intervals. \n(E) Penta KO cells expressing GFP–OPTN and GFP–NDP52 at 45 min after treatment with CCCP and wortmannin. Wortmannin was added to inhibit autophagosome formation so that OPTN is not sequestered in a closed compartment.

Mathematical models of condensate formation and localization of autophagy adaptors.\n(A) Schematic diagram of two separated mitochondria.\n(B) Sheet-like condensates of autophagy adaptors on mitochondria deform when the inter-mitochondrial distance d_Mt was changed. The strength of adaptor self-interaction (χ_self), adaptor–ubiquitin interaction (χ_Ub), mitochondrial area exclusion (χ_Mt) and surface tension (σ) were set to χ_self=3k_B T, χ_Ub=12k_B T, χ_Mt=5k_B T, and σ=k_B T, respectively. The color indicates the adaptor concentration (ϕ_ad). Arrowheads indicate autophagy adaptors filling the cleft between the two mitochondria.\n(C) Schematic diagram of a single mitochondrion with an isolation membrane.\n(D) Sheet-like condensates of autophagy adaptors on mitochondria deformed when the isolation membrane (arrowheads) appeared and the angle α surrounding the mitochondria changed. The strength of adaptor self-interaction (χ_self), adaptor–ubiquitin interaction (χ_Ub), adaptor–LC3 interaction (χ_LC3), mitochondrial area exclusion (χ_Mt), isolation membrane area exclusion (χ_IM), and surface tension (σ) were set to χ_self=3k_B T, χ_Ub=χ_LC3=12k_B T,  χ_Mt=χ_IM=〖5k〗_B T, and σ=k_B T, respectively.
