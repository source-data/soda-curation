Differences were statistically analyzedby one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-hoc test.Figure EV2. p62 on mitochondrial clusters andOPTN and NDP52 at the mitochondria-isolation membrane contactsites are resistant to 1,6-hexanediol treatment.(A) Penta KO cells expressing GFP–p62 at 45 min after CCCP treatment.Images of cells before (left) and 2 min after (right) the addition of10% 1,6-hexanediol are displayed.

Images of cells before (upper panels) and 2min after (lower panels) the addition of 10% 2,5-hexanediol aredisplayed. Scale bars, 5 μm and 2 μm (magnified images).(C) Penta KO cells expressing GFP–OPTN (left) or GFP–NDP52 (right) at45 min after CCCP treatment. Mitochondria associated with isolationmembranes (LC3) were analyzed. Images of cells before (upper panels) and2 min after (lower panels) the addition of 10% 1,6-hexanediol aredisplayed. Scale bars, 5 μm and 2 μm (magnified images).Figure EV3: Droplet distribution depends on the bindingstrength.(A) Dependence of droplet distribution on two mitochondria onUb-binding strength (<spanclass=\"math inline\">χUb</span>)and self-binding strength (<spanclass=\"math inline\">χself</span>).Mitochondrial area exclusion (<spanclass=\"math inline\">χMt</span>)and surface tension (<span class=\"math inline\">σ</span>) wereset to <spanclass=\"math inline\">χMt\u2004=\u20045kBT</span>and <spanclass=\"math inline\">σ\u2004=\u2004kBT</span>,respectively.(B) Dependence of droplet distribution on isolation membrane andmitochondria on LC3-binding strength (<spanclass=\"math inline\">χLC3</span>).The other parameters were set to <spanclass=\"math inline\">χMt\u2004=\u20045kBT</span>,<spanclass=\"math inline\">σ\u2004=\u2004kBT</span>,<spanclass=\"math inline\">χself\u2004=\u20043kBT</span>and <spanclass=\"math inline\">χUb\u2004=\u200412kBT</span>.The bending angle of the isolation membrane was set to <spanclass=\"math inline\">α\u2004=\u2004π/3</span>.Figure EV4. Loss of mobility and mitophagy activity withubiquitin binding mutants of OPTN.(A) Penta KO cells expressing both GFP–OPTN and mRuby–Ub (i),GPF–OPTN (E478G) and mRuby–Ub (ii), both GPF–OPTN (E478G) and anti-GFPnanobody–mRuby–Ub (iii), both GFP–OPTNΔUBAN and anti-GFPnanobody–mRuby–Ub (iv), and both OPTNΔUBAN–GFP and anti-GFPnanobody–mRuby–Ub (v) at 45 min after CCCP treatment. Time-lapse imagesof GFP FRAP are shown. Photobleached areas are circled by dotted lines.Scale bars indicate 4 μm and 2 μm (magnified images).(B) Quantification of GFP FRAP on separate mitochondria (Mt) in pentaKO cells expressing both GFP–OPTN and mRuby–Ub (i), both GPF–OPTN(E478G) and anti-GFP nanobody–mRuby–Ub (iii), both GFP–OPTNΔUBAN andanti-GFP nanobody–mRuby–Ub (iv), and both OPTNΔUBAN–GFP and anti-GFPnanobody–mRuby–Ub (v) at 45 min after CCCP treatment. Data werecollected from four structures and were fitted to the equation y = a*(1− exp(−b*x)). The dark shading represents the 95% confidence intervals,and the light shading represents the 95% prediction intervals.(C and D) Representative data (C) and quantification (D) of HaloTag(Halo) processing assay using cells expressing the indicated OPTN and Ubconstructs. Cells expressing the mtHalo–SNAP mitophagy reporter weretreated without (0 h) and with oligomycin and antimycin for 18 h. Theamount of processed Halo (proc. Halo) indicates the relative amount ofmitochondria degraded in lysosomes. Solid horizontal bars indicate themeans, and dots indicate the data from three independent cultures.Differences were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variancewith Dunnett’s post-hoc test.Figure EV5. Recruitment of TBK1 and FIP200 duringmitophagy.(A, B) Localization of FIP200 and phosphorylated TBK1 undermitophagy-inducing conditions (CCCP, 60 min). Endogenous FIP200 (A) andphosphorylated TBK1 (B) were immunostained in penta KO cells expressingboth GFP–OPTN and mRuby–Ub or both GFP–OPTNΔUBAN and anti-GFPnanobody–mRuby–Ub together with mitochondrially targeted Halo–SNAP(mtHalo–SNAP).
