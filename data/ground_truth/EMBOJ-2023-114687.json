Inhibition of ENaC endocytosis by knockdown of FCHO2 or Nedd4L.\nAfter cells were transfected with each siRNA, cell-surface ENaC was\nlabeled by incubating at 4°C with anti-FLAG antibody. Endocytosis was\nstarted by incubating cells at 37°C for the indicated periods of time\nand stopped by chilling cells on ice. Antibody bound to the cell surface\nbut not internalized was removed by acid stripping. After cells were\nsolubilized, the antibody-labeled internalized ENaC subunits were\nprecipitated and analyzed by IB (upper panel) and quantified (bottom and\nright panels). Internalization was expressed as a percentage of the\ninitial amount of cell-surface αENaC determined by lysing cells without\nincubation at 37°C or acid stripping.
