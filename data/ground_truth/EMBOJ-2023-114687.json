      "figure_caption": "A. Knockdown of FCHO2 or Nedd4L by siRNA. αβγENaC-HeLa cells treated with each siRNA were analyzed by immunoblotting (IB).\n\nB. Inhibition of ENaC endocytosis by knockdown of FCHO2 or Nedd4L. After cells were transfected with each siRNA, cell-surface ENaC was labeled by incubating at 4°C with anti-FLAG antibody. Endocytosis was started by incubating cells at 37°C for the indicated periods of time and stopped by chilling cells on ice. Antibody bound to the cell surface but not internalized was removed by acid stripping. After cells were solubilized, the antibody-labeled internalized ENaC subunits were precipitated and analyzed by IB (upper panel) and quantified (bottom and right panels). Internalization was expressed as a percentage of the initial amount of cell-surface αENaC determined by lysing cells without incubation at 37°C or acid stripping. Data are shown as the mean ± S.E.M. of three independent experiments. **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 (Student's t-test). \n\nC. Inhibition of transferrin receptor (TfR) endocytosis by FCHO2 knockdown. After cells were transfected with each siRNA, cell-surface proteins were biotinylated at 4°C. Cells were then incubated at 37°C for 10 min. Biotin was removed from the cell surface, and internalized biotinylated proteins were precipitated with avidin beads. Samples were subjected to IB with anti-TfR antibody and quantified. Internalization was expressed as a proportion of the initial amount of TfR on the cell surface. Data are shown as the mean ± S.E.M. of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 (Student's t-test).\n\n\n\nD. Restoration of αENaC endocytosis by FCHO2 re-expression in knockdown cells. After cells were transfected with the indicated siRNA and GFP construct, cell-surface αENaC was labeled with anti-FLAG antibody at 4°C. Cells were then incubated at 37°C for 10 min. After acid stripping, cells were subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy (left panels) and quantified (right panel). The antibody-labeled, internalized αENaC was visualized with a fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody. The border of each cell is delineated by a solid line. Arrows indicate cells expressing GFP-tagged proteins. Scale bars, 10 μm. The proportion of cells with internalized αENaC among cells expressing control GFP or GFP-siRNA-resistant (sr) -FCHO2 is shown. Data are shown as the mean ± S.E.M. of five independent images (31-71 cells expressing GFP-tagged proteins per image). ***P < 0.001 (two-way analysis of variance with post hoc test).\n\nE, F. Effects of FCHO2, Nedd4L, and FBP17 knockdown on ENaC ubiquitination and expression at the cell surface. After cells were transfected with each siRNA, cell-surface αENaC was biotinylated and sequentially precipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and then avidin beads. Samples were subjected to IB with anti-FLAG and anti-Ub antibodies (E) and quantified (F). E, ENaC ubiquitination, Asterisks indicate the same band of ubiquitinated FLAG-αENaC. F, ENaC expression at the cell surface. Data are shown as the mean ± S.E.M. of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05 (Student's t-test).",
