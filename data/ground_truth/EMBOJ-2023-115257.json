The solid\nline inside the box represents the median. Whiskers represent the max\nand min values. Values that are not within 1.5 times the interquartile\nrange are considered as outliers and lie outside the whiskers.\n<strong>G)</strong> Osteoimage stained mineral matrix quantification\n(upper panels), images (central panels), and Alizarin Red (lower panels)\n9 days after L1 RNA or RFP RNA delivery in 3 OP patients derived MSCs\n(HUK9, HUK12, HUK16).
